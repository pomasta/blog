I graduated from the [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/) with a BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in 2014. In 2019 I began working toward my MESM Economics and Politics of the Environment [The Bren School For Environmental Science and Management](http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/). My two foci at the Bren School are Environmental Data Science and Science Communication. I look forward to a future career in impact investing and pursuing hobbies related to science communication.
